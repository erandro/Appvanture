# Appvanture
This is a mix of event searcher and social communicator. a platform where users can connect over an event.

# Motivation
As human beans, we like to socialize, and going to events alone is never fun.
imagine you are in a new city, or maybe none of your friends are free during the weekend or maybe you just have other interest than anyone around you. our platform gives you the chance to connect with people with the same interest over events such as concert, theater, sports events and more.

# Concept
The overall concept is simple:
Get in - Search and pick event - Connect
We keep it simple, fast and intuitive.

# Technologies used
In addition to HTML5, CSS and Javascript, we used Bootstrap, Jquery, Hover.css, Gravatar, MD5, Material Design Lite, Firebase, Seatgeek API and Unsplash API.

# Design process
Our Design process was:
1. Building the foundation for the UX.
2. Adding the API search.
3. Adding the database authorization
4. Adding the Connect feature.

# Improvements
We feel like there is still room to improve.

From a UX perspective, we believe we can:
* Modify user searches by adding interests inputs.
* Improve the connectivity between users by notifications, comments of events and emails (between users)

From a UI perspective, we believe we can: 
* Add more information and general options for events.
* Adding avatars to the users (not only in the comment section).
* add hide/show function to make the web simple and efficient.
* Make the website more responsive and interactive (it is responsive right now, but some more styling is needed).

From an Investor perspective, we believe we can:
* Reference purchasing options, such as tickets and merchandise (from a third party).
* Promoting events for clients through our search result, emails, and more.
