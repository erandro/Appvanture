# Appvanture
This is a mix of event searcher and social communicator. a platform where users can connect over an event.

As human beans, we like to socialize, and going to events alone is never fun.
imagine you are in a new city, or maybe none of your friends are free during the weekend or maybe you just have other interest than anyone around you. our platform gives you the chance to connect with people with the same interest over events such as concert, theater, sports events and more.
